#  Conditionals
#  ---------------------------------
#  Write a conditional statement that checks if a student has passed
#  - if the grade is less than 50 then return "failed"
#  - if 50 or higher then return "passed"
#
####


grade1 = 49

# Add your code here
if grade1 < 50:
    print(str(grade1) + ": failed")
elif grade1 >= 50:
    print(str(grade1) + ": passed")


#### 
#EXPECTED RESULT
#---------------
#49: failed
