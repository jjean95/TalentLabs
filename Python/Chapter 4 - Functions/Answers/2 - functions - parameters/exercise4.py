# Write a function that adds two numbers together
# Call the function, passing 13 and 124 as parameters, 
# and assigning the returned value to a variable "sum_of_values"

# Step 1: Declare your function first
def addition(x,y):
    return x + y

# Step 2: Call the function and assign to a variable `sum`
sum = addition(13,124)
sum_of_values =  sum # Complete this line

# DO NOT CHANGE CODE BELOW
print(sum_of_values)

# Expected Output
# 137
